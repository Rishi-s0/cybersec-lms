# Video Content

This directory contains course video files for the CyberSec LMS.

## Video Files (Not in Repository)

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the actual video files are not stored in this repository. 

### For Development:
1. Create your own video content or use placeholder videos
2. Name them according to the pattern: `lesson[number]-[topic].mp4`
3. Place them in this directory

### For Production:
- Use a CDN service (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.) for video hosting
- Update the video URLs in the course content
- Consider using video streaming services for better performance

### Expected Video Files:
- `lesson1-cybersecurity-intro.mp4`
- `lesson2-cyber-threats.mp4` 
- `lesson3-security-best-practices.mp4`
- `lesson4-incident-response.mp4`
- `lesson5-security-mindset.mp4`

### Alternative Solutions:
1. **YouTube Integration**: Upload videos to YouTube and embed them
2. **Vimeo Integration**: Use Vimeo for professional video hosting
3. **CDN Storage**: Use AWS S3 + CloudFront for video delivery
4. **Video Streaming**: Implement adaptive streaming for better performance
